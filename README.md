# Cleato

This the project made in my second semester as a part of Course Project for the subject machinacs and robotics  

The project is phycial model of a automated flore cleaning robot  

The robot has a bult  
* Arduino UNO development doard
* Ultrasonic sensor 
* PIR motion sensor
* L298N Motor driver
* DC Motors
* Li-Po baterries
* Buzzer


The robot having an cleaning actuator in front of it  
And the robot will detect the object distance in front of it and after comming i a range then it checks which side it has space to move and takes trun to that side  
Also if living being comes or goes from its front then it will check it with PIR mtion detecting sensor and dosent take turn and ring the buzzer so that the person should move away from the way and it will continue its trajectory

By following a snake trajectory in zic-zac manner it will cover the whole room and the robott will stop at the opposite corner as that from were it has started  

Therefor the Robot is a automatic cleaning Robot **Cleato**
